# Speedrun Ethereum - Challenge 6: Stablecoins

## 📖 Introduction
This repository contains my solution for **Challenge 6: Stablecoins** from the Speedrun Ethereum curriculum.

The goal of this challenge is to build a decentralized stablecoin system that allows users to:

- **Mint Stablecoins**: Users can mint stablecoins by depositing collateral.
- **Redeem Stablecoins**: Redeem stablecoins to retrieve the collateral.
- **Staking Rewards**: Stake stablecoins to earn rewards.
- **Interest Rate Control**: Adjust interest rates dynamically based on market conditions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Scaffold-ETH 2
- **Smart Contract**: Solidity
- **Frontend**: Next.js, RainbowKit, Tailwind CSS
- **Environment**: Hardhat (Localhost)

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure your machine meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Version >= 18.17 (LTS recommended)
- **Yarn**: v1 or v2+ (Package manager)
- **Git**: Version control system

To verify your installations, run:

```bash
node -v
yarn -v
git --version
```

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup Guide
This project uses Scaffold-ETH 2, which requires running three separate terminals to simulate the blockchain environment, deploy contracts, and host the frontend.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and clone the project code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LightyWind22/challenge-6-stablecoins.git
cd challenge-6-stablecoins
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install all necessary node modules for both the Hardhat backend and the Next.js frontend:

```bash
yarn install
```

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run (3-Terminal Workflow)
Please follow these steps in order. You will need three separate terminal windows/tabs open.

### Terminal 1: Start the Local Blockchain
This command starts a local Ethereum network (Hardhat network) on your machine. Keep this terminal running.

```bash
yarn chain
```

### Terminal 2: Deploy Smart Contracts
Open a second terminal. This command deploys the stablecoin-related smart contracts to the local network created in Terminal 1.

```bash
yarn deploy
```

> **Note**: If you modify the smart contract code later, you must run `yarn deploy` again.

### Terminal 3: Start the Frontend
Open a third terminal. This command starts the React/Next.js application.

```bash
yarn start
```

Once started, open your web browser and navigate to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Terminal 4: Run Tests
Open a fourth terminal. This command runs the tests for the Stablecoin smart contracts.

```bash
yarn test
```

> **Note**: This will execute the Hardhat tests with gas reporting enabled.

## 🧪 How to Test the Functionality
Once the application is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), follow these steps to verify the solution:

1. **Connect Wallet**:
   - Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right.
   - Use the "Burner Wallet" (a temporary local wallet) generated by the app.

2. **Mint Stablecoins**:
   - Navigate to the "Stablecoins" section.
   - Deposit collateral and mint stablecoins.
   - **Verification**: Ensure the stablecoin balance increases.

3. **Redeem Stablecoins**:
   - Redeem stablecoins to retrieve the collateral.
   - **Verification**: Ensure the collateral is unlocked and returned.

4. **Stake Stablecoins**:
   - Stake stablecoins to earn rewards.
   - **Verification**: Ensure rewards accumulate over time.

5. **Adjust Interest Rates**:
   - Use the interest rate controller to adjust rates dynamically.
   - **Verification**: Ensure the changes reflect in the borrowing/staking rates.
